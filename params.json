{"name":"Beam","tagline":"A type-safe, non-TH Haskell SQL library and ORM","body":"# Beam: a type-safe, non-TH Haskell relational database library and ORM\r\n\r\nBeam is a Haskell interface to relational databases. Its key strengths are its type-safety and intuitive syntax.\r\nBeam is written in a pure Haskell, and doesn't make use of Template Haskell or non-intuitive embedded domain specific languages.\r\nInstead it makes extensive use of Generics, Closed Type Families, and other elements of Haskell's strong type system.\r\nUnlike other popular Haskell database interfaces, Beam tries to work with the compiler rather than in spite of it.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see http://travis.athougies.net/projects/beam.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
